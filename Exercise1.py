    | ``1   It does not print the fruit at the correct index, why is the returned result wrong?``
            A: The fruits value is a Set, which means its elements are unordered.
    | ``2   How could this be fixed?``asd
            A: Instead of a Set, use a List to maintain index order for fruits param by replacing curly braces {} with square brackets [].

    This example demonstrates the issue:
    name1, name3 and name4 are expected to correspond to the strings at the indices 1, 3, and 4:
    'orange', 'kiwi' and 'strawberry'..

    >>> name1 = id_to_fruit(1, {"apple", "orange", "melon", "kiwi", "strawberry"})
    >>> name3 = id_to_fruit(3, {"apple", "orange", "melon", "kiwi", "strawberry"})
    >>> name4 = id_to_fruit(4, {"apple", "orange", "melon", "kiwi", "strawberry"})
