    This code plots the precision-recall curve based on data from a .csv file,
    where precision is on the x-axis and recall is on the y-axis.
    It it not so important right now what precision and recall means.

    | ``1   For some reason the plot is not showing correctly, can you find out what is going wrong?``
    | ``2   How could this be fixed?``

    This example demonstrates the issue.
    It first generates some data in a csv file format and the plots it using the ``plot_data`` method.
    If you manually check the coordinates and then check the plot, they do not correspond.
